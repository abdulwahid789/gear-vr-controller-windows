# gear-vr-controller-windows

Finally on windows!
The Samsung Gear VR Controller can be utilised as an emulated mouse (and gamepad).

This project is written in C#, but I decided not to provide any binaries.
Ever heard about LINQPad - The .NET Programmer's Playground https://www.linqpad.net ?
The supplied gear-vr-controller.linq can be opened and executed with LINQPad 5.
Works better with corporate machines.

Program is "AS IS", and I take no liabilities for any damage it causes.

This is an initial commit, WIP.
